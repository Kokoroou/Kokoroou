## Explanation
File README in this repository is created by many special parts:
1. Banner \
This banner is the combination of __HTML__ and __CSS__ \
You can put __HTML__ (actually __XHTML__) and __CSS__ inside a `<foreignObject>` tag inside a SVG file inside an `<img>` tag inside your readme.
2. Badge
3. Emoji

## Future work
1. Add more information about me
2. Add animation to README's banner
3. Add a small game to README
